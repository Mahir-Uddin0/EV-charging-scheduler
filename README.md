# ⚡ EV Charging Scheduler – Constraint Programming Model (MiniZinc)

This project implements an Electric Vehicle (EV) charging scheduler using **MiniZinc**. It schedules EVs to available charging stations over time slots while minimizing the total travel distance. The model considers constraints like battery level, charging rate, station availability, power and plug capacities.
