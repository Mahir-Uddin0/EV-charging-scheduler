# ‚ö° EV Charging Scheduler ‚Äì Constraint Programming Model (MiniZinc)

This project implements an Electric Vehicle (EV) charging scheduler using **MiniZinc**. It schedules EVs to available charging stations over time slots while minimizing the total travel distance. The model considers constraints like battery level, charging rate, station availability, power and plug capacities.
## Introduction
As the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) increases globally, efficient charging management has become a major challenge. EVs need to be charged at appropriate times and locations while ensuring that charging stations are not overloaded. Traditional manual or first-come-first-serve scheduling is not sufficient for large-scale operations such as ride-sharing fleets, logistics companies, or smart city infrastructures.  

To address this, automated AI-driven scheduling systems are required. These systems must account for real-world constraints like limited charging plugs, varying power capacities, and fluctuating battery levels of EVs. Moreover, optimizing charging schedules can reduce energy costs, minimize vehicle downtime, and extend battery health.  

This project presents a **constraint programming approach** using **MiniZinc** to solve the EV charging scheduling problem. By modeling vehicles, stations, and charging slots as decision variables, the system automatically generates an optimized charging plan.

## üìã Problem Statement

Given:
- A number of EVs with current battery levels and charging requirements.
- Charging stations with a fixed number of plugs and power capacity.
- Availability of stations at different time slots.
- Coordinates of both EVs and stations.

The model:
- Determines **which EV should charge at which station and at what time slot**.
- Ensures that no station exceeds its plug or power capacity.
- Minimizes the **total distance** traveled by EVs to charge.
- Ensures only EVs below a battery threshold are scheduled.
- Prefers **continuous** charging periods (no fragmentation).
